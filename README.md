Project 1 repository

This project made a clock run in both standard time and military time

I believe I did a good job writing out the functions seperately outside of the main function so they are reusable.

I think my main function could have been simplified and more intuative to read.

Working with loops and input to add incrementaly will be usefull for other projects that take a lot of input

I made this project maintainable and readable by adding comments but looking back the comments I added were pretty bad and did not fully describe 
what was happening in the project they just gave a general outline.
